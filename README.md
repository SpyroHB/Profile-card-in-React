##How it is done: 
    Following along with a YouTube Vido while re-editing the components to make it more personal Project.
    Almost all project was hard-coded but in future project i will use a Props and Use databases to not hard-code anymore
##Steps:
   - In Components we have 2 files Card.js and Card.css,Whole project is coded there and linking it to App.js,
         because project is small and simple and it doesn't need to be seprated "Over Engineered"
    - Using a upper and lower container to make the code easy to style.
    - The img was linked  to my github profile picture
    -to make social buttons i linked a Cdn font 
        in "index.html"
        ```
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
        ```
