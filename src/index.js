Challenge : Completed 

How it is done: 
    Following along with a YouTube Vido while re-editing the components to make it more personal Project.
    Almost all project was hard-coded but in future project i will use a Props and Use databases to not hard-code anymore
Steps:
    In Components we have 2 files Card.js and Card.css, The whole project is coded there,
    because project is small and simple and it doesn't need to be seprated "Over Engineered"
    Using a upper and lower container to make the code easy to style.
    The img was linked  to my github profile picture
    to make social buttons i linked a Cdn font in "index.html"
